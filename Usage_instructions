The Project is for accelerating multiresolution convolutions. Currently, a morlet wavelet function is generated and analysed, other multiresolution functions can be implemented by changing the generation code inside Mask generate.

By Default, the values in our current simulation are
Input signal = "Generates a Doppler signal of 1024000 samples"
Mask = "Morlet wavelet Generated by PyWavelets". We also have a mask generation code that runs on GPU and is more precise, but for the test, we use pywavelets for comparison purposes!

All other additional features are disabled by enumerating them to 0 for the automated test. They can be enabled by enumerating the values to 1.
