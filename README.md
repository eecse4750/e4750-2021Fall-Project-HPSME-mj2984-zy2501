Seed (team/shared) repo for team projects
  - distributed as Github Repo and shared via Github Classroom
  - contains only README.md file
  - The students should upload their project code into the repo
  - The organization of the directories, python, CUDA and OpenCL files has to be meaningful, and described in this README file

# Detailed instructions how to submit this assignment/homework/project:
1. The project assignment will be distributed as a github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. A students copy of the repo gets created automatically with a special name -> students have to rename the repo per instructions below
